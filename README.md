### User Requirements & Expectations

### Design Decisions

When designing the website, I carried out some market research to see what the general design choices for similar websites. As part of my research, I found that there was generally an attractive look to websites with a floral theme throughout which is keeping to the wedding theme.

#### Fonts 

When deciding the fonts that I would use on this website, I searched through Google Fonts to see if there were any fonts that looked attractive and sleek and that would look good when styled. I decided have used Sans-Serif as a backup font in case Google Fonts does not work for any reason.

* A pretty, almost floral design that will remind the user of a wedding setting.
* A booking form which allows the prospective customer to contact the site owner easily. 
* Links to the site owners social media pages through slick Font Awesome icons. This is a important as the site owner has a lot of content here which will give the prospective customers an in-depth view of the potential of the service provided in addition to what is on the website.  
* The site email in case the site visitor wants to contact the site owner and not make a booking. These are also displayed with Font Awesome icons.
